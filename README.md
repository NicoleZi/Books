Project Title: Books

What does the application?
List of Books.
The user enters his book entries manually.
The book entries got saved in a database.
And the books got displayed in two lists
 - a general all books list,
 - and in a tbr list, which contains all unread marked books.
(Only tested for android with android emulator)

Used Technologies:
- Visual Studio
- .Net Maui
- C#
- SQLite

Most Challenging Part for myself:
Get a specific listobject from the <DataTemplate> for the tbr list, to change the order.

Features (possible for the future):
- Share your books with Friends
- Drag n' Drop to change order of the tbr list
- Autofill for new book entries

How to run/ install the project:
The folder "Books/Publish_Dateien" contains a .apk file. 
You can load the file on your android phone, then click and install.
The Visual Studio Android Emulator was used during development.
